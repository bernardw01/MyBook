# Chapter One An Introduction to Expectation Management

## Introduction ##
Over the past several years it has become apparent there are many factors that negatively impact project success.  A key portion of this problem is the concept of project success in the eyes of the stakeholder.  In the end no project can be successful unless the key stakeholder’s expectations have been managed and met. 

Expectation management means
- Understanding what the customer wants/needs
- Understanding the context of the customers wants/needs
- Understanding the customers priorities

Failure to meet your stakeholder’s expectations always results in a feeling of disappointment with the stakeholder. If they aren’t disappointed then they did not have a real expectation.  Expectations can be implied or explicit.  Both are equally important and can each result in the stakeholder feeling like their expectation has not been met.
