## Introduction ##
From the begining of recorded history people have had expectations of others that those people, more often than not, failed to meet.Expectation management is a topic that spans all of time and is plastered across the human expereince.  There are those people in this world who, for one reason or another, have mastered the ability to effectively track and manage the expectations of others in order to achieve a satisfied stakeholder.  This book is for the rest of us.

Over the past several years it has become apparent there are many factors that negatively impact project success.  A key portion of this problem is the concept of project success in the eyes of the stakeholder.  In the end no project can be successful unless the key stakeholder’s expectations have been managed and met. 

Expectation management means
* Understanding what the customer wants/needs
* Understanding the context of the customers wants/needs
* Understanding the customers priorities

Failure to meet your stakeholder’s expectations always results in a feeling of disappointment with the stakeholder. If they aren’t disappointed then they did not have a real expectation.  Expectations can be implied or explicit.  Both are equally important and can each result in the stakeholder feeling like their expectation has not been met. 

## What is Expectation Management ##
In a nutshell, expectation management is simply the effective use of communication tools to gather, assimiliate and react to the stated and unstated expectations of other people and organizations.

Ask most people and they will tell you that they do not like the car buying experience.  If there was  away for you to be sure that you were paying a fair price for the car that you were purchasing and that you would not regret the purchase of this big ticket item in just a few months, you would likely be able to sleep a lot better.  You go into the experience with the expectation that you are going to be disappointed even though you are paying a great deal of money.  That would make anyone feel uneasy.
